        <h2> What is Tomorrow Toonies? </h2>
        <p>
            Tomorrow Toonies are a small team working on a NFT & Metaverse Project that want to get the general population involved in the NFT space to show the everyday use of these amazing assets. We're working on growing with our <a style="color: green" href="https://discord.gg/Qhf97ZA7hx" target="_blank">Discord Server</a> being one of our key goals to grow and expand as a community is nothing without the people. Also we plan on working on Metaverse Events via games such as Echo VR, Rec Room & Fortnite in the future for players to compete for a custom made (for the event) NFT with our whole project being Free-To-Join and no costs for anyone directly from us.
