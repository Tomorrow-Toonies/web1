																<h3>When did Tomorrow Toonies start?</h3>
																<p>
																	We started work on our first NFTs around 2022-01-15 (GMT) releasing the First NFT early morning of 2022-01-16 (GMT). Our full vision took about a week to see the possibility of what we could do using the Polygon Blockchain and our ideas just keep coming for what this technology could do for people. Along with what other services we could bring to people in the near and far future needless to say we have a lot in the works and we hope you enjoy it and maybe join us in this journey.
